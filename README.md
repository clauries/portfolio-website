## Concept
AS a bootcamp graduate,
I WANT to have a space to display my work
SO THAT potential employers, mentors, and teammates can find me and review my work.

## Tech Utilized
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* jQuery
* AOS
* Font Awesome

## Future Development
* Deployment to personal website.
* Additional animation components.
* Utilize another CSS framework to create cards in place of the images in the portfolio section. Front of cards will be images. These cards will be animated to flip as a mouse moves over them revealing a description and the links. 
* Utilize another animation framework to develop animation in header where there is some additional space. Design/animation to be determined.

## Credits
* Responsive layout and instruction on utilizing AOS was adapted from a youtube tutorial by Julio Codes over 2 videos. Check out [video 1](https://youtu.be/T7PnWnTgusc) for layout and [video 2](https://youtu.be/inCl01EJkts) for AOS animation.
